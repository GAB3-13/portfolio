            Ken Car$on has been seeing a huge increase in popularity in the last year with his EP Teen X: Relapsed and his debut album Project X. His use of heavy synths and 808s with repetitive hooks is reminiscent of Carti’s most recent “punk” sound with his own twist. He has production credits on “Beno!” off of Whole Lotta Red as well as close affiliation with production team 808 Mafia, proving to be a multitalented artist.</figcaption>
