        Richard Saturnino Owens (born November 18, 1962) is an American fashion
        designer from Porterville, California. In addition to his main line,
        Owens has a furniture line and a number of diffusion lines. Owens
        launched his fashion line in 1994, operating out of a store in Hollywood
        Boulevard. He moved to Paris in 2003 with his companion Michèle Lamy,
        whom he married in 2006, and set up his home and atelier inside a
        historic five-story building that previously served as offices for
        former French President François Mitterrand. His runway collections have
        been mounted in Paris since then.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2004, Owens and Michèle Lamy
        established their own fashion company Owenscorp, and described their
        business partnership as “asking a gypsy to organise a war with a
        fascist.” In 2013, Owens exhibited his 'Prehistoric' collection at
        Carpenters Workshop Gallery in London. Owens' design colour palette in
        this seven piece collection stretches from white to black, stopping
        nowhere in between. "The show is entitled 'Prehistoric', a name that
        reflects its inspiration, the origins of humanity , it recalls a
        mysterious ancient civilization. Its aura is one of spiritual ritual,
        archaic ceremony and supreme power".
